  # AUTO REVIEWER V 0.1

GIT - 
* Have the Backend and Frontend envirornments added to the GIT task.
* Lets have every granular subtask be properly version controlled with GIT by having the tasks create a branch from the main and then rebase the commits back to the main and create clean PRs.
 

Frontend - a shadui components powered react SPA. The main page should have this as the UI. 2 markdown editor - both half the page wide and full page high, and a run button between these markdown files. 
Once the play button is pressed an API is called with payload from the first markdown and the response is filled into the other markdown.

Backend - Lets use the GCP file and the GCP class to create the API endpoint. Lets use Fast API for the endppoint exposing.

Every task needs to be first broken down into granular single responsibility sub tasks and be assigned a task-id which will be used to initiate the development work.
